		<h1>Chapter 19</h1>
		<h2>Eleven Years Later</h2>
			<p>It was eleven years before I returned to England. It was an evening in December, an hour or so after dark, when I quietly pushed upon the kitchen door of the house on the marshes. There, smoking his pipe by the fire, was Joe, only a little gray. And opposite him, sitting on my own old little stool, was a little Pip!</p>
			
			<p>Joe jumped up to welcome me back and kept touching me to make sure it was really me. But the little boy hung back. Biddy rushed in and cried and kissed me.</p>
            <p>After a few days, young Pip &mdash; for he had been named after me &mdash; and I became friends. </p>
            <p>We went for walks on the marshes, and I showed him my family&apos;s tombstomes. To understand him thoughts and feelings, I had only to remember my own at his age in this place.
            </p>
            <p>By the time I left, Pip was as attached to me as I had been to Joe when I was young. He stood by the forge and waved and waved until I was out of sight.</p>
			
			<p>Before I left for London, I went to visit the site of Miss Havisham&apos;s house. Nothing of the burned-out house remained; only the garden was there, pushing widly into the space once occupied by the house. I went through the old gate, no longer locked, and sat on a stone bench. Thoughts of Estella came rushing to me. I had heard that heer life with Bentley Drummle had been most unhappy, unhappy enough to cause her to leave him. And I had heard that he had been killed in a riding accident soon after. But that had been two yearsago, and perhaps she had since remarried. I wandered farther back in the garden, which looked stripped and desolate in the winter air. The figure of a woman stood forlornly in the moonlight, and, hearing my footsteps, she turned. We recognized one another at the same time.
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>Estella!</em></strong> I cried out and rushed to her.
            <cite>"I am greatly changed, Pip," </cite> she said softly. <cite>"It is a wonder that you recognized me." </cite>
            </p>
            <p>The youthful freshness was indeed gone, but she had lept the majesty and charm of her beauty. Her proud eyes were changed also and now held a soft, saddened look. We sat down on a bench, and I asked if she came here often. 
            <cite>"No, I came here tonight for the first time, to say good-bye to the place. This property was my last possession, and I have sold it. Do you still live abroad, Pip?"</cite>   </p>
            <p>I told her about my partnership with Clarriker and Company, and she seemed pleased. 
                <cite>"I have thought of you often,"</cite> said Estella. <cite>"For a time, I could not bear to think of you &mdash; of your love that I had thrown away in my ignorance. But now I have given it a place in my heart." </cite>She smiled gently.
            </p>
            <p>
                <cite>"You have always had a place in my heart,"</cite> I said, taking her hand in mine.
            </p>
            <p>We sat in silence for a time, then in a low voice, Estella said, <cite>"My suffering all these years has come to be a stronger teacher to me than all other teachers. I have been bent and broken, but I hope into a better shape. Since I must part from you again, I am glad that our parting is taking place here, in a place that I must also part with. I hope you have forgiven me and will be as considerate of me as you once were, and that we shall part as friends."</cite></p>
            <p><cite>"We are friends,"</cite> I said firmly. <cite>"As for parting, that remains to be seen."</cite>
            </p>
            <p>We rose the bench, her hand still in mine, and walked slowly away together, leaving the shadow of Miss Havisham behind</p>
